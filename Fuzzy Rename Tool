# in the terminal below type python -m pip install fuzzymatcher
# using python -m pip install instead of pip install since pip doesn't exist in PATH variable
# For renaming incorrect or unclean names based on a list of correct names to match

# See Excel file - Fuzzy Rename Tool General - CL.xlsx
#     List 2 Names tab - list of desired and correct names/investment names
#     Original name excel tab - list of names that need to be changed


# Then run the code below, this will create a new file named "Fuzzy Renamed Results" where you should check to make sure all names were correctly renamed; you may need to rename a few manually

# One time step if fuzzymodule is not found even after install:
# You have to go to https://www.sqlite.org/download.html and Download appropriate dll files from Precompiled Binaries for Windows section of this page. You must download either 32bit or 64bit according to your hardware architecture.

# Extract the zip file and copy the content and paste and then manually paste it into "your python \bin folder" or anaconda bin.
